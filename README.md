# House Prices Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using a Linear Regression model. The dataset used for training and validation is provided in the `train.csv` file, while predictions are made on the test dataset provided in the `test.csv` file. The main goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts house prices based on various features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. The required libraries are listed in the Python script, including NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-prices-prediction.git
    cd house-prices-prediction
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script provided (`linear_regression_house_prices.ipynb` or `linear_regression_house_prices.py`).
2. The script reads the training and test datasets, performs data preprocessing, and trains a Linear Regression model.
3. The model is evaluated on a validation set using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
4. Predictions are made on the test dataset, and the results are displayed.

## File Structure

- `linear_regression_house_prices.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and predictions.
- `linear_regression_house_prices.py`: Python script equivalent to the Jupyter notebook.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset files (`train.csv` and `test.csv`).
- `output/`: Directory to store the model predictions.

## Results

The trained Linear Regression model demonstrates promising results on the validation set, with predictions close to the actual house prices. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is also calculated to quantify the model's performance.
